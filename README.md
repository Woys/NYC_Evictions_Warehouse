# NYC_Evictions_Warehouse

This is the repository for a group project I completed as part of CIS 4400 (Data Warehousing for Analytics) at Baruch College. 
Our goal was to get data from NYC Open Data with Socrata API, create Data Warehouse using Google Big Quiery and dbt and create visualisation with Tableau.

**Tools/technologies:** 
Google BigQuery, SQL, ELT with dbt, Tableau.
